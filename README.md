# Animal Personality Survey

[https://express-survey.herokuapp.com/](https://express-survey.herokuapp.com/)

This is a survey to help you determine your personality type! It is the 5 minute version of the Meyers-Briggs test.

More Information [from](https://www3.dbu.edu/jeanhumphreys/SocialPsych/smalleytrentpersonality.htm):

*Lions are leaders, decisive, bottom line, problem-solvers, not conversational.

*Otters are fun-loving, entertainers, net workers, motivators, creative, talkers.

*Retrievers are loving, nurturing, loyal, good listeners, encouragers.

*Beavers are hard-working, detailed, accurate, focused on quality.

Consciously work to become more aware of your natural tendencies. Go for a healthy balance, tempering any extreme problem area, focus on your strengths and learn to cultivate the strengths of less dominant personality traits.

Some suggestions for each personality type:

*Lions: Be softer and more gentle and include others when making decisions.

*Otters: Think before you speak, and consider consequences before you act.

*Retrievers: Practice saying no and making firm decisions.

*Beavers: Learn to relax and donâ€™t expect others to do things just like you.
